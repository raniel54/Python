## Description

This is the beginning level python project to do some awesome drawing animation using the `turtle` module, hope it grows in the future
It is a Python module for animating drawings of images. The sketchpy module is created on top of the turtle module in Python.
To install sketchpy on your computer, you can go to your command prompt (command line) and run the following command.

### Usage

- Just install the package `pip install sketchpy`
- Import it to you project `import sketchpy` and use as you wantüòä

### Built with

- Turtle 
- Open-cv
- Pillow
- numpy

# Drawing from `SVG` file

Use the following code to draw a file from svg file, insted of tracing full image

#### NOTE: use this specific website to convert image to svg, sketchpy is specifically made to work with this [website](https://svgconvert.com/#/) only

```
    from sketchpy import canvas
    obj = canvas.sketch_from_svg('FILE PATH')
    obj.draw()
```

# `Saving` a loaded svg file

Insted of waiting for the svg file to load, you can save as .npy file and use that for future use

```
    from sketchpy import canvas
    obj = canvas.sketch_from_svg('FILE PATH')
    obj.load_svg(filename = 'data.npy')
```

## Drawing form `.npy` file

use the following code to draw your image from saved data file

```
    from sketchpy import canvas
    obj = canvas.sketch_from_svg('FILE PATH')
    obj.draw(filename = 'data.npy')
``` 

## Drawing from `raw image`

use the following code to draw any image, it need not to be an svg file
```
    from sketchpy import canvas
    obj = canvas.sketch_from_image('IMAGE PATH')
    obj.draw(threshold = 127)
```
#### NOTE: you can change the value of threshold to draw more detailed image, it's range is 0 - 255,use values between 90-190
